### Teamspeak Badges  

**Master Holder/Knife Catcher & Scuba Diver Badges by Whalepool**  
  
Master Holder/Knifecatcher/Scubadive badges on Whalepool show off your experience, skill set (or lack of) to ther uses. This helps raise your profile as person to be listened to and as a veteran trader not a newb.    
The person responsible for appointing all Master Holder, Knife catcher & Scubadiver Badges is RJ - @Rjknew    
    
The rules for qualification can change over time.    
    
**Master Holder Qualifications**  
For level 1, you need to show a 1000% P&L screenshot from bitmex (or equivilant on OKex) with a minimium of 10,000 contracts (bitmex).  
For level >= 2, your minimium position size must be a least 100,000 contracts of equivilant on okex.    

These badges can only be applied to bitmex and okex positions trading BTCUSD pairs.   
For each 1000% P&L you get, you get 1 level up. HOWEVER, if you have 3 accounts andn trading perps + quarts on each account, and have 1000% P&L on 3 x 2 positions, you will still only get 1 level up, because essentially there has only been 1 x 10% move captured.    
    
To submit your entry, send a screenshot of your position to @Rjknew - You MUST include the full position details because obviously contract must be checked, entry price must be checked (to make sure its not an alternate account etc), contract size must be checked.  
  
No trade history submissions  
No historical submissions  
Very simple, same rules for everyone, send a screenshot of the full position with 1000% P&L from bitmex. Easy.    
    
**Knife Catcher Qualification**  
To qualify for the knifecatcher badge you must show you catching a seriously deep week, ideally 30% move + on or near the bottom on a nice decent high timeframe wick. No 1 hour wicks. No little dips. You caught the bottom of a seriously scary ass plunge.     
No non bitmex/okex positions allowed, no trade history submission. Keep it simple.  
    
**Scuba Diver Qualification**  
To qualify for the scuba diver badge you must have a leverag long which you held massively underwater where you basically shit your pants and held through it and came out the other side.   
No non bitmex/okex positions allowed, no trade history submission. Keep it simple.
